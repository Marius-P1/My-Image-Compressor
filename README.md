# Image Compressor

Image Compressor is a project developed as part of the "Functional programming" module in the second year at Epitech. The objective of this project is to implement a program in the functional programming paradigm to compress images using a specific algorithm.

## Usage

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
$ make
```

3. Run the program with the following command:

```bash
$ ./imageCompressor -n N -l L -f F
```

Where:
- N is the number of colors in the final image
- L is the convergence limit
- F is the path to the file containing the colors of the pixels

## Features

The program includes the following features:

- Read the file containing the colors of the pixels
- Compress the image using the K-means algorithm
- Display the compressed image

## Contributors

This project was developed by Marius Pain and Simon Ganier-Lombard, as part of the "Functional programming" module in the second year at Epitech.
